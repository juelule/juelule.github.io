    <h2>Baby J vs the Forces of Nature</h2>
    
    <p>It was my own fault for wanting to save a couple bucks.</p>

    <p>I went to the second hand electronics store to buy a monitor. It thankfully worked, but the cord that I bought (an hdmi cord) did not-- these fuckers use a displayport, which I had never heard of in my life. </p>

    <p>So I went to walmart to try and find a displayport to usb c cord, which of course they didn't have. Instead I settled for a display port to hdmi adapter and an hdmi to usb c cord because that is what they did have. Madness.</p>

    <p>The digital landscape is in shambles! I really don't understand why we don't just have one cord for everything but that is an investigation for another day. I'm sure engineers smarter than I could explain it but the cynical part of me is sure it's just to get you to BUY a million fucking cords.</p>

    <p>When I walk out of the walmart to catch the bus it isn't raining. But as soon as I walk out of the shopping center where I could possibly find shelter, in a matter of seconds it rains so powerfully with winds at just the right angle that I am completely drenched despite my umbrella and raincoat. It rained so hard it flooded part of my backpack.</p>

    <p>It was incredibly humbling to say the least. And then of course the bus was late, because why wouldn't it be. Tuck that away for whenever politicians say a bus is just as reliable as rail. Buses are still at the whim of traffic, while most rails have a dedicated lane. Local trains also suffer delays but 28 whole minutes? C'mon now. 
    
    <p>The rain was only frighteningly powerful for maybe a couple of minutes that could've been spent indoors if I hadn't been in a hurry to catch a bus that wasn't actually on time. A series of unfortunate decisions. I was so angry with myself, miserable and wet but of course when I got home I reconsidered. How could I have possibly known?</p>

    <p>And anyways, what harm does a little rain do? Maybe a bit of discomfort, but at the end of the day I had a home to go to and a dry set of clothes, in a relatively peaceful place. There's tons of people who don't share the privilege. I am guilty of being a natural born curmudgeon but I am in favor of changing my ways and I believe in learning from mistakes and regretful situations. So what did I learn from this ordeal? I really need to get my fucking license...</p>
