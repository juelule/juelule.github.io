    <h1>Lock the Doors</h1>

    <p>This morning when I signed in at the building where my studio is I said to myself 'I can't believe it's June 1st already...' the year is almost halfway over</p>

    <p>Lately I have been doing a lot of Sudoku, because someone told me it might help my memory problems (I'll drink to that!)</p>

    <p>I know I've done a bunch of stuff this year but I don't remember. If you asked me what I did this year my mind would go blank. I read somewhere that there maybe a sinister component to this: depression sometimes prevents memories moving from short to long term, because you're so busy dealing with your illness you can't form the memories you're supposed to.  </p>

    <p>I think that's why I'm so motivated to make zines and (currently) start this blog: because I'm going to forget. But if I give it form here, then I have somewhere I can come back to it. </p>

    <p>Over the past couple of days i've been reading a ton about disasters: on everest, k2, nanda devi, in the amazon, the andes, in space, challenger and columbia.</p>

    <p>Lock the doors, nothing comes in our out it's OVER.</p>

    <p>it stood out to me, it sounded so much like wanting to maintain composure in the face of something so harrowing</p>
    <p>i'm not sure why i'm so compelled, maybe because i feel the presentiment of something dangerous lurking over my shoulder-- only time can tell</p>

    <p>maybe it's just the age old game of worrying about your mortalityleaving your legacy, what are my unfinished projects? i have so many if i was to go today there would be so much i haven't done and I would hate to go with the scales tilted towards the unseen and unheard. i know that i will probably die in the middle of a project, but i would at least like for the stack on my finished pile to be taller than unfinshed.</p>

    <p>what i've learned over the past 25 years: you just have to do it. you can't complain. make your art no matter what. no excuses. eat your bowl of nails and wash it down with a nice glass of spoilt milk.</p>

    <p>so yet again i embark on this journey, and me being me i romanticize it before it's even started. an adventurer wanting to see as much as they possibly can and to shape their experiences into something tangible that can move people, or provide some insight, or to just make people feel less alone. i hope something here can make you feel less alone<p>

    memory is our only companion sometimes. there are things we go through that only we alone know, our memories serve as our confidantes in   </p>
